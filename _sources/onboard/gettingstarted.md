## Introduction to napari's Python requirements

Like every software package out there, napari is written with a programming language. For example, Windows is based in *C*, various statistics programs are written in *R*, and ImageJ is based on *Java*. Napari is written with a language called *Python*. 

Python is a widely popular scientific computing language with many years of contributions under its belt. As such, there are multitudes of tools (and algorithms) that a program like napari can leverage to accomplish its tasks. Python, by default, is not pre-installed on most computers, and one needs to manually install it in order to execute Python-based programs.  

Although this is likely to change in the future, there is no “quick install” of napari (and its requisite Python coding language). Here we walk through the steps necessary for doing so, including getting Python installed on your machine, and subsequently the individual commands necessary for installing napari itself. This particular tutorial will focus on installing the aforementioned on a Windows machine.
