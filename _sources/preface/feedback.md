## Who built this

The napari cell segmentation learning course is a open source project of Chan Zuckerberg Intiative (“CZI”) in collaboration with premier Imaging Scientists from across the world. You can learn more about the project [here](./whomadethis.md).

## Something’s not working in the lessons, how do I get help?
Oh no! We’re sorry you’ve hit a snag. Check the [napari Github issues](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues), the Github page for an individual plugin (linked on the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/) plugin page), [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/napari), or reach out at team@napari-hub.org.
 
## How can I provide feedback on the existing lessons?
[We welcome any and all feedback](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-segmentation-workshop/issues) on this course. We strive to make these materials as approachable as possible. We encourage you to share your thoughts on these materials (e.g. accessibility, quality, and comprehensiveness, etc.). We intend these learning materials to be reproducible, and adaptable, much like napari itself. Otherwise, feel free to send an email to us at team@napari-hub.org.
