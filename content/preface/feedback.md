# Frequently Asked Questions

We hope these questions will help you in your napari learning journey! If you need additional information or assistance, you can reach a human at team@napari-hub.org.

#### Who built this
The napari cell segmentation learning course is a open source project of Chan Zuckerberg Intiative (“CZI”) in collaboration with premier Imaging Scientists from across the world. You can learn more about the project [here](./whomadethis.md).

#### Something’s not working in the lessons, how do I get help?
Oh no! We’re sorry you’ve hit a snag. Check the [napari Github issues](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues), the Github page for an individual plugin (linked on the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/) plugin page), [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/tag/napari), or reach out at team@napari-hub.org.
 
#### How can I provide feedback on the existing lessons?
[We welcome any and all feedback](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-segmentation-workshop/issues) on this course. We strive to make these materials as approachable as possible. We encourage you to share your thoughts on these materials (e.g. accessibility, quality, and comprehensiveness, etc.). We intend these learning materials to be reproducible, and adaptable, much like napari itself. Otherwise, feel free to send an email to us at team@napari-hub.org.

If you’re new to napari, welcome and don’t fret! [napari](www.napari.org) will help you install and get viewing in no time. <!-- Good time to introduce our introductory documents or at least provide a link to Getting Started.

Bug reports should be made on napari’s github issues using the bug report template. If you think something isn’t working, don’t hesitate to reach out - it is probably us and not you!
 
#### How do I get help with napari plugins?  
  
Plugin authors are encouraged to add links to their listing on the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/), showing users of their plugin where to find help.

If the plugin author has not indicated where to get help, the [image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/) community is a great place to ask questions about napari and napari plugins.
 
#### I have a neat idea or question you didn’t answer here.
Oh no, we didn’t answer your questions! Our apologies. We recommend you ask any community questions in [github discussions for napari](https://github.com/napari/napari/discussions) and/or the [napari hub discussions](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-hub/discussions) - we value open source engagement and you never know who might have the right answer! Otherwise, you can reach a human at team@napari-hub.org.
