# Background to segmentation course

In the 1st half of 2022, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Imaging Tech team and a cohort of imaging scientists came together to develop learning materials for napari. Specifically, these learning materials were designed for research biologists *without any Python or coding experience*, and intended to onboard said users onto napari so they could perform cell segmentation workflows using a curated set of plugins hosted on the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.org).  

In the spirit of the open-source community, these materials may be updated and contributed to much [like napari itself](https://napari.org/developers/contributing.html), and will likely be iterated upon as video production, plugin functionality, and the napari platform evolves over time.
