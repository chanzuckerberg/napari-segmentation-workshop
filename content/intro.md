# Welcome to the napari cell segmentation course!

If you've arrived on this Jupyter Book, that means you likely have an interest in **cell biology, imaging analysis**, and all the applications of the [**open-source napari platform**](https://www.napari.org)! By following this course, you’ll learn all the fundamentals to performing cell segmentation in napari on your own data. Although napari currently requires *some* Python and command prompt/terminal experience, we try to keep it to *a minimum* in all our lessons. 

:::{note}
While anyone can follow along, this course has been created with **research biologists, microscopy**, and **experimental design** in mind. If you have a broader interest in napari, we invite you to browse the [range of uses](https://www.napari.org/gallery.html) for the platform, as well as the [napari hub](https://www.napari-hub.com).

**Instructions**

We've designed this course into three stages (requiring **at least 8 hours** to fully complete), each consisting of small snippets of narrated video (recorded by [the Bravo Cohort](preface/landing.md)), accompained by text explanations, a glossary of relevant terms, sample data, and exercises. We encourage you to complete this at your own pace, aiming for a lesson a day. 

1. Beginning at **[the onboarding stage](onboard/landing.md)**, you'll learn more about what napari is, and how it compares to other imaging platforms. We guide you through an installation of the latest version of the napari viewer, and how we enhance its functionality with plugins.    
  <br>

2. By **[the final workflow stage](workflow/landing.md)**, we focus on the terminology behind segmentation, then dig into three case studies that illustrate how to perform a cell segmentation workflow from start to finish within napari, using sample data (or your own).
